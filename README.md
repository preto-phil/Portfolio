# The Odin Project Portfolio Project

<!-- ## Overview

Welcome to my Odin Project Portfolio! This project showcases my skills and progress as I complete The Odin Project curriculum. In this README, I'll provide an overview of my project, the technologies I used, and acknowledge some valuable resources.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: I structured my portfolio using HTML, organizing content and layout.
- **CSS**: I styled the portfolio with CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: I used JavaScript to add interactivity and enhance the user experience.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the following resources and tools that contributed to the development of this portfolio:

- **Design Files**: I downloaded the design files (desktop, tablet, mobile) to guide the layout and visual design of my portfolio.
- **Images**: Portraits in the design files were sourced from Pexels.com, and other placeholder images were used.
- **Fonts**: I incorporated Playfair Display and Roboto fonts from Google Fonts, enhancing the typography of the portfolio.
- **Icons**: Icon-links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter were obtained from [devicon.dev](https://devicon.dev/), and other icons (phone, email, and external link) were downloaded as SVGs from [materialdesignicons.com](https://materialdesignicons.com/).
